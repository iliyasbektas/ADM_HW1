# ADM_HW1
### These are my solutions for HW1 for ADM course of the University of Sapienza's data science department.

##### For graders' information:

This is not a full list of all exercises. I did ones that I could solve. For example, I know some basic regex commands but the ones given were quite difficult.
Sometimes, hackerrank does not read codes that are easily digested in jupyter notebook. So, even though sometimes it is shown that the exercise, the code itself is good
I have to admit that there was sufficient googling, otherwise I would have spent more than week on these exercises
Overall, it was quite challenging and simultaneously beneficial.
